    short_description: 'Begin your journey to making a difference by creating your fundraiser with just a few clicks. Provide essential details about the cause, set a fundraising goal, and add a compelling story to engage potential donors.'
    description: "Joining monthly donation plans offers a powerful way to sustainably support causes close to your heart. By committing to regular contributions, you provide ongoing assistance to organizations and communities in need. These consistent donations enable charities to plan ahead, budget effectively, and implement long-term solutions to pressing issues. Moreover, monthly giving allows you to spread your support throughout the year, making philanthropy more manageable and accessible within your budget. Beyond the practical benefits, becoming a monthly donor fosters a deeper connection to the causes you support, knowing that your contributions make a meaningful and lasting impact. Joining a monthly donation plan is not just about giving; it's about creating positive change, one donation at a time."
