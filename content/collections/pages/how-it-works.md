    heading: 'What is Crowdfunding?'
    short_description: 'Crowdfunding is a modern method of fundraising that leverages the power of the internet and social networks to gather small contributions from a large number of people.'
    explainetion: |-
      Crowdfunding is a collective effort to fund projects or ventures by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the internet. It provides a platform for individuals, businesses, or organizations to pitch their ideas or causes and invite contributions from a global audience. Whether it's launching a new product, supporting a social cause, or covering unexpected expenses, crowdfunding allows creators to bypass traditional financing methods and directly engage with supporters.

      It democratizes fundraising, empowering both creators and backers to connect, collaborate, and make meaningful impacts together.
