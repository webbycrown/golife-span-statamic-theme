Riza's condition is deteriorating day by day. We are all waiting for a healthy donor, but Riza is suffering from intense stomach pain every minute. Currently, the doctors at NG hospital are unable to relieve her pain until she receives a healthy donor heart. She is currently receiving Melirinone injectable pump support at an increased dosage. Her face, abdomen, and legs have swollen severely. Her condition will be temporarily eased with diuretics.
